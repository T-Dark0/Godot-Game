    // To ensure that the graph is fully connected, we first begin a minimum spanning tree before adding more edges
    // randomly to make it more interesting.

    // a room A may not connect to a room B if there exists a room C between them, blocking the way
    // 
    // Given a room A, there always is at least one other room that it can reach without a third room being in the way:
    // if there _is_ a room in the way, then that room, not the originally intended one, is a room that A can reach
    // However, there doesn't have to always be a room that isn't yet connected to A. (in fact, in an MST implementation
    // without the "no rooms in the way" constraint, every node would be able to find another node to connect to, except for the
    // very last node visited).
    // In our case, it's possible for a room that _isn't_ the last to be unable to find another room to connect to,
    // because all reachable candidates are already connected to it
    // In that case, we simply discard the room and don't bother connecting it to anything
